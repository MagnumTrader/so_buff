# so_buff

Does less things than[Arrayvec](https://docs.rs/arrayvec/latest/arrayvec/)
You should probably use Arrayvec instead.

Made for my own use case where i need a buffer that gets passed and then consumed.
No pushing after you have started consuming.

Could be achieved with the new type pattern over an Arrayvec but where is the fun in that? :)
